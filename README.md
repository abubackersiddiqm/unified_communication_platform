## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abubackersiddiqm/unified_communication_platform.git
   cd unified_communication_platform
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv env
   env\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder:

   ``` env
   # Use PostgreSQL
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:dbpassword@localhost:5432/dbname

   # Secret key for security
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

   > **Note:** If you are using **SQLite**, leave the `DATABASE_URL` value
   > empty, e.g.Â 
   >
   > ``` env
   > DATABASE_URL=
   > ```

4. **Initialize the database:**
   ```
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python backend/run.py
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Demo Credentials

If running in demo mode, use:
- **Username:** `demo`
- **Password:** `demo123`


## Troubleshooting

- **Database connection errors:**  
  Ensure PostgreSQL is running and credentials in `.env` are correct.

- **`psql` not recognized:**  
  Add PostgreSQL's `bin` directory to your system PATH.

- **Migration errors:**  
  Make sure Flask-Migrate is installed and initialized in your code.
